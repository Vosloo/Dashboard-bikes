In order to use the city bikes, citizens purchase access for a day, week or the entire cycling season that lasts from April to November. All passes include an unlimited number of 30-minute bike rides. For an extra fee of 1 Euro/hour, you can use the bike for longer. Bikes are picked up and returned to stations that are located all around Helsinki and Espoo.
